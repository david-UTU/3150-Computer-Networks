# Notes


### Why Packet Switching over Circuit Switching?
- packet switching allows more users to use the network
- traffic is bursty in nature
- true cause of congestion is simply the amount of traffic, nothing else

### Math Time
- Binomial distribution
  - Probability = (numOfUsers choose n ) * p^n * (1 - p )^(numOfUsers-n)
- Transmission delay: L/R, where L is the packet length in bits and R is the link transmission rate (bits per second)
- Propagation delay: d/s, where d is the length of the physical length and s is the propagation speed (~2 * 10^8 m/sec)
- Packet Queueing Delay: La/R
  - L is still the packet length
  - a is the average packet arrival rate
  - R is the link bandwidth
